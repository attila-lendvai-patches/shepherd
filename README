* An -*- outline -*- of the GNU Daemon Shepherd.

** What is the Shepherd?

The GNU Daemon Shepherd or GNU Shepherd is a service manager written in
Guile that looks after the herd of system services, providing a
replacement for the service-managing capabilities of SysV-init (or any
other init) with a dependency-based system with a convenient interface.
It is intended for use on GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd, but it is supposed to work
on every POSIX-like system where Guile is available.

In a previous life, the GNU Shepherd was known as GNU dmd, the
daemon-managing daemon.

** Requirements

The GNU Shepherd depends on the following pieces of software:

  - GNU Guile 3.0.x or 2.2.x, https://gnu.org/software/guile
  - Fibers 1.1.0 or later, https://github.com/wingo/fibers

** Getting started

Like all GNU packages, this program can be installed using familiar
incantations such as:

  ./configure --prefix=/some/where
  make
  make check
  make install

Actually setting up the Shepherd currently requires some work.  You
should read the Texinfo manual for details:

  info -f shepherd.info

** Installing development snapshots with Guix

The Shepherd repository can be used as a Guix “channel”.  To do that, change
~/.config/guix/channels.scm along these lines:

  (append (list (channel
		 (name 'shepherd)
		 (url "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/shepherd.git")
		 (introduction
		  (make-channel-introduction
		   "788a6d6f1d5c170db68aa4bbfb77024fdc468ed3"
		   (openpgp-fingerprint
		    "3CE464558A84FDC69DB40CFB090B11993D9AEBB5")))))
	  %default-channels)

Once that is done, run ‘guix pull’.  This will give you additional ‘shepherd’
packages with higher version numbers:

  guix package -A shepherd

You can then install it with ‘guix install shepherd’, or e.g. use it in an
operating-system configuration:

  (operating-system
    ...
    (essential-services
     (modify-services (operating-system-default-essential-services
                       this-operating-system)
       (shepherd-root-service-type
        config =>
        (shepherd-configuration
         (inherit config)
         (shepherd (@ (shepherd-package) shepherd)))))))

The GNU Shepherd is developed jointly with the GNU Guix project.  Both
are essential components in putting the pieces together to build the GNU
system.  Join us now!

** Hacking

Using GNU Guix, you can enter a development environment by running:

  guix shell -D -f guix.scm

or simply:

  guix shell

You can authenticate the code in this repository by running:

  guix git authenticate				\
      788a6d6f1d5c170db68aa4bbfb77024fdc468ed3	\
      3CE464558A84FDC69DB40CFB090B11993D9AEBB5

The command silently exits with zero on success, and errors out
otherwise.  We recommend invoking it from ‘.git/hooks/pre-push’.

** Reporting bugs

Send bug reports to <bug-guix@gnu.org>, with "Shepherd" and the version
number in the Subject line.
